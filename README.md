# Bus-Reservation-System

Developed a mini Project, a Bus Reservation System using singly, doubly, and circular linked lists to dynamically manage entities such as buses, drivers, seats, and reservations, ensuring efficient insertion, deletion, updating, and display operations.

Enhanced system performance and scalability through custom algorithms that optimize resource utilization, minimize overbooking, and handle large volumes of reservations seamlessly.
